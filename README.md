# Welcome

I'm broadly interested in cryptography and representation theory.

I'm currently building:

- [Whirlwind](https://github.com/pretzeledkoala/whirlwind): A highly customizable blazing-fast workstation for scribing faster in-class LaTeX notes
- [Fusion](https://github.com/pretzeledkoala/fusion): A Rust codebase for composable commit-and-prove zkSNARKs

I also extensively write about things I'm interested in on my [blog](https://pretzeledkoala.vercel.app/) and on [X](https://x.com/pretzeledkoala).
